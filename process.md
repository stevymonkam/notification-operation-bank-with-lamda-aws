# Banking Notification Implementation Process with AWS

## 1. Architecture Design

### 1.1. Architecture Diagram
- Create a diagram representing the interconnected services:
- API Gateway for entry points
- Lambda for processing
- DynamoDB for data storage
- SES for sending emails
- EventBridge for event management
- CloudWatch for monitoring
- S3 to store deployment artifacts

## 2. AWS Services Configuration

### 2.1. IAM and Secret Manager
- **Access Management:**
- Create IAM roles with the necessary permissions to access DynamoDB and send emails via SES.
- Use AWS Secrets Manager to store sensitive information.

### 2.2. DynamoDB
- **Database Configuration:**
- Design a database structure to store user information and their operations.

### 2.3. S3
- **S3 Configuration:**
- Create an S3 bucket to store deployment artifacts (ZIP files of Lambda code).

## 3. Setting Up Business Logic

### 3.1. AWS Lambda
- **Lambda Function Development:**
- Write functions to process notifications and interact with DynamoDB.
- Deploy Lambda function code from artifacts stored in S3.

### 3.2. API Gateway
- **API Creation:**
- Define endpoints for notification operations.

## 4. Event Management

### 4.1. Amazon EventBridge
- **Rules Setup:**
- Create rules to trigger events based on banking transactions.
- Integrate events with Lambda functions.

## 5. Sending Notifications

### 5.1. Amazon SES
- **Amazon SES Setup:**
- Verify domains and email addresses for sending emails.

## 6. Monitoring and Management

### 6.1. Amazon CloudWatch
- **Monitoring Setup:**
- Configure log groups to collect logs from Lambda functions and API Gateways.
- Create alarms to track important metrics.

## 7. Testing and Validation

### 7.1. Functionality Testing
- Perform unit and integration testing to ensure all components work together.

### 7.2. Load Scenarios
- Simulate load scenarios to test the scalability of the architecture.

## 8. Deployment and Maintenance

### 8.1. Deployment
- Use AWS CloudFormation or another infrastructure as code tool to deploy the architecture.
- Deploy Lambda code from artifacts stored in S3.

### 8.2. Maintenance
- Set up a maintenance plan to monitor and update resources as needed.
